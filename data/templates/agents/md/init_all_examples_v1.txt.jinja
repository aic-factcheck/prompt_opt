# Instructions
I will give you several examples of query and answer text pairs.
Your task is to give me clear instructions on how to transform the queries into the corresponding answers by myself.

Proceed in the following steps:
1) Describe the query format in detail:
 - Is it plain text, JSON, XML, HTML, or other common format? Describe it.
 - Describe its structure in detail.
 - Does it use any special symbols or tags?
2) Similarly describe the answer format.
3) Hypothesize about possible query to answer transforms:
 - Note that more than the provided examples may be needed to infer the rules to construct the answers from the queries and that there may be multiple explanations.
 - If there are more possibilities, enumerate them.
 - If you can't find the explanation, say it.

# Examples
The examples follow:
{% for ex in dataset %}
## Example {{ loop.index }}
### Answer
{{ ex.answer }}

### Query
{{ ex.query }}
{% endfor %}
