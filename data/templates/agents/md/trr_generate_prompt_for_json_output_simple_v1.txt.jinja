After presenting you all available examples, your task is to give me clear and highly detailed instructions that will perform the query-to-answer transformation.

I will use these instructions to construct a prompt to get answers for yet unseen queries.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not copy any full examples from the training examples above!
- Do not add any synthetic examples of the query-answer pairs!
- On the other hand, you can provide examples of individual query or answer elements.
 
As always, use Markdown with the "Thinking," "Reflection," and "Response" sections. The content of the "Response" section key will contain only the instructions and nothing else.
