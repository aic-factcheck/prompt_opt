# Instructions
I will give you several examples of query and answer text pairs.
The answer uses JSON format using the following schema:

{{ schema }}

Your task is to give me clear instructions on how to transform the queries into the corresponding answers by myself.

Proceed in the following steps:
1) Describe the query format in detail:
 - Is it plain text, JSON, XML, HTML, or other common format? Describe it.
 - Describe its structure in detail.
 - Does it use any special symbols or tags?
2) Similarly describe the answer structure:
 - Give details on all important elements of the output JSON.
 - Describe semantics of all values.
 - Tell if order of lists or dictionaries is important or not. 
3) Hypothesize about possible query to answer transforms:
 - Note that more than the provided examples may be needed to infer the rules to construct the answers from the queries and that there may be multiple explanations.
 - If there are more possibilities, enumerate them.
 - If you can't find the explanation, say it.

# Examples
The examples follow:
{% for ex in dataset %}
## Example {{ loop.index }}
### Answer
{{ ex.answer }}

### Query
{{ ex.query }}
{% endfor %}
