After presenting you all available examples, your task is to generate a zero-shot prompt that will perform the query-to-answer transformation for yet unseen queries:
1) If there were more hypotheses on how the query-to-answer transform works, choose the most probable one and explain why.
2) Generate a prompt that will perform the correct transformation for a new yet unseen query. 

The generated prompt should adhere to the following conditions:
1) Generalization: The prompt must generalize well to unseen queries.
2) Detail: the prompt must give all important details of the query to answer transform.
3) No examples: the prompt MUST be zero-shot:
 - Do not copy any example from the training data above!
 - Do not give any full synthetic examples of query-answer pairs!
 - On the other hand, you can provide examples of small parts of queries and answers, if needed.
4) Query/answer formats: provide a description of both query and answer formats:
 - Use placeholders, if needed, to adhere to the zero-shot property.
 - The answer format is JSON having this schema:

{{ schema }}

5) Format: the generated prompt itself will be plain text with some basic formatting (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.)
 
As always, use Markdown with the "Thinking," "Reflection," and "Response" sections. The content of the "Response" section key will be a string containing only the generated prompt and nothing else.
To use the generated prompt, I will append a query part of an unseen example enclosed within <query></query> tags.
IMPORTANT: Do not add the query yourself!

Think thoroughly.
