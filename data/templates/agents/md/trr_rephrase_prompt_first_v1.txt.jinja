LLMs are known to be sensitive to even small changes, such as different capitalization or formatting.
We are dealing with prompts having the following format:
1) Instructions describing a query-to-answer transformation.
2) The query enclosed within <query></query> tags.

The LLM answer to the prompt is a JSON having the following schema:
{{ schema }}

You will be given only the instruction part of the prompt (the prompt without the query).
Your task is to give me a modified version of the instructions but ensure the meaning is still perfectly preserved.
The modifications should be mild, e.g., changes in capitalization, formatting, and small replacements (True instead of Yes, Q instead of Question, etc.)

As always, use Markdown with the "Thinking," "Reflection," and "Response" sections. The content of the "Response" section key will contain only the instructions and nothing else.

The prompt instructions to be modified follows:
{{ prompt }}
