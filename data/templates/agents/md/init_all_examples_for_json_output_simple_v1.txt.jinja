# Instructions
I will give you several examples of query and answer text pairs.
The answer uses JSON format with the following schema:

{{ schema }}

Your task is to give me clear and detailed instructions on how to transform the queries into the corresponding answers by myself.
Note that more than the provided examples may be needed to infer the rules to construct the answers from the queries and that there may be multiple explanations.
Consider that query and answer may use different text styles as well as other languages than English.

# Examples
The examples follow:
{% for ex in dataset %}
## Example {{ loop.index }}
### Query
{{ ex.query }}

### Answer
{{ ex.answer }}
{% endfor %}
