I have provided an example of an error in query-to-answer transformation caused by the initial prompt.
You have analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the prompt by comparing the predicted and gold answers.
Now, your task is to carefully design a new and improved prompt that corrects errors like those observed, ensuring that responses are generally more aligned with the gold targets.

We are dealing with prompts having the following format:
1) Instructions describing a query-to-answer transformation.
2) The query enclosed within <query></query> tags.

Importantly, the prompt is zero-shot, so:
- Do not copy any complete examples from above!
- Do not add any synthetic examples of the complete query-answer pairs!
- On the other hand, you can provide examples of individual query or answer elements.

Your response will contain only the instruction part of the prompt and nothing else. Importantly, do not add any query or query placeholder.
