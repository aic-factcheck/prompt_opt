I gave you several examples of how the prompt at the start of our conversation transforms queries into answers.
You have analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the prompt based on each example, comparing predicted and gold answers.
It is time to think thoroughly and design a new, improved prompt that leads to answers closer to the gold targets.

We are dealing with prompts having the following format:
1) Instructions describing a query-to-answer transformation.
2) The query enclosed within <query></query> tags.

Importantly, the prompt is zero-shot, so:
- Do not copy any complete examples from above!
- Do not add any synthetic examples of the complete query-answer pairs!
- On the other hand, you can provide examples of individual query or answer elements.

Start with the <think> tag. The text after closing </think> will contain only the instruction part of the prompt and nothing else. Importantly, do not add any query or query placeholder.
