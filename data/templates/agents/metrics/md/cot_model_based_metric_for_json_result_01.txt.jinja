Ok, you have thought about the "predicted" vs. "gold" JSONs. Now, give me the final verdict in the following Markdown format:

```markdown
# Reasoning 
< Put streamlined reasoning for the "predicted" quality assessment. Focus on the "Evaluation categories" above, giving instructions on how to correct the predictions. Use structured form. If the prediction exactly matches the gold, make this just one sentence. >

# Score
< Put the resulting score (integer number in range 0-100). No other text comes here!>
```
